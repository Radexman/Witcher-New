# Witcher-New
This project is not for commercial purposes and I have not any financial benefits from it. Assets and art is made by CD Project Red,
I take no credit from it. This app is essentially one big love card from me to CDPR because I love Witcher universe and I always wanted
to have companion app for the tabletop game so I did one myself. This app is still work in progress due to it's size, it's the biggest
project in my portfolio. Only me and couple of my friends are using it I am not sharing it.
